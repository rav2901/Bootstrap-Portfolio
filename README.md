# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## Description
This week, I've learend about Bootstrap framework. I wanted to understand Bootstrap better so I've made a portofolio using it.
I've used a navbar, jumbotron and card section. I've made the footer section without using Bootstrap because I was only required to write a small amount of code.
I did not change the navbar much, I've only had to remove a few elements. I've customised the jumbotron by adding an image on the left and a paragraph on the right. In the grid/ card section, I added 2 more cards and position them differently to the original bootstrap.
I find Bootstrap very helpful as it saves a lot of time and it's user friendly, even for beginners!
